# - Script displays Usage: manage_my_process {start|stop|restart} when nothing is passed or something different than start, stop, or restart
# - Script creates /var/run/my_process.pid file when started
# - Script starts manage_my_process process when started
# - Script deletes /var/run/my_process.pid file when stopped
